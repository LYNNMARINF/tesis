# Copilot Instructions for AI Coding Agents

## Project Overview
This repository appears to be in its initial state, with only a `README.md` and `LICENSE` file present. No source code, configuration, or documentation about architecture, workflows, or conventions is currently available.

## Guidance for AI Agents
- **Project Structure**: No code or project structure is present yet. Revisit these instructions after code is added.
- **Workflows**: No build, test, or debug workflows are defined. If you add code, document any new workflows here.
- **Conventions**: No project-specific conventions or patterns are established. Use standard practices for your chosen language/framework until further documentation is provided.
- **Dependencies**: No external dependencies or integrations are defined.

## Next Steps
- Update this file as the project evolves, especially when adding source code, configuration, or documentation.
- Reference key files and directories as they are created to help future contributors and AI agents understand the project.
